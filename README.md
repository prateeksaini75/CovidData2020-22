# CovidData2020-22
 Data Collecting: Data is collected from the website (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
 Data cleaning: This csv file contains both covid death information as well as covid vaccination.
 Data Wrangling: I have divided the columns related to covid deaths and covid vaccinations in different excel files and arranged the columns preferably in order.
 Data Analysis: As Data is very large to analyze in excel, I have used SQl for analysis and did analysis on whole data by keeping in mind of our main objective.
 Data Visualiization: By selecting the few most immportant SQL queries, tables are extracted from queries to the Seperate excel files for tableau visualization.
 Finally as a result I have a very impressive dashboard which portray my whole research in an easy format which can be understandable to key stakeholders.
